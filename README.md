# ZeroDivisionError in Average Calculation

This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the `ZeroDivisionError` that can occur when calculating the average of a list of numbers. The original code lacks proper error handling for empty lists and lists containing only zeros.

The `bug.py` file contains the faulty code.  The `bugSolution.py` file shows the corrected version with robust error handling.

This is a simple yet illustrative example of the importance of defensive programming and anticipating edge cases.
